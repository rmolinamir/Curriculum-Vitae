In this repository you'll find all of the files I used for my Curriculum Vitae Web App. You'll find things such as a Redux Saga that detect if the user is using a Mobile device or not, and if so, it implements a polyfill that enables smooth scrolling on mobile devices as well, just like in desktops or laptops (think, 'scrollTo{...options, behavior: smooth}').

Other things such as a Chart component, a Parallax, Navbar with a SideDrawer for small devices, and more. Lots of images, mostly SVGs, a component that mimics typing on an IDE by displaying my CV details, and some FlipCard components capable of displaying videos.

The CSS is also optimized for most browsers, and the design is responsive enough, and almost all of the CSS files excluding the index.css file are CSS modules, already configured by the React v16.6 webpack.

Feel free to ask me any questions, or contact me at [rmolinamir@gmail.com](hmailto:rmolinamir@gmail.com). I'll do my best to get back to you as soon as I can.

Obligatory mention to everyone involved in the making of the '[React 16 - The Complete Guide (incl. React Router 4 & Redux)](https://www.udemy.com/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux)' online course, can't recomment enough.

Feel free to use anything, no need to credit me at all but I'd love to know my stuff is used somewhere in the internet at least :)
