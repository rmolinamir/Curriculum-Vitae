### `My Curriculum Vitae`
[My Curriculum Vitae](https://robertmolinamir.firebaseapp.com/)

In this repository you'll find all of the files I used for my Curriculum Vitae Web App. You'll find things such as a Redux Saga that detect if the user is using a Mobile device or not, and if so, it implements a polyfill that enables smooth scrolling on mobile devices as well, just like in desktops or laptops (think, 'scrollTo{...options, behavior: smooth}').

Other things such as a Chart component, a Parallax, Navbar with a SideDrawer for small devices, and more. Lots of images, mostly SVGs, a component that mimics typing on an IDE by displaying my CV details, and some FlipCard components capable of displaying videos.

The CSS is also optimized for most browsers, and the design is responsive enough, and almost all of the CSS files excluding the index.css file are CSS modules, already configured by the React v16.6 webpack.

Feel free to ask me any questions, or contact me at [rmolinamir@gmail.com](hmailto:rmolinamir@gmail.com). I'll do my best to get back to you as soon as I can.

Obligatory mention to everyone involved in the making of the '[React 16 - The Complete Guide (incl. React Router 4 & Redux)](https://www.udemy.com/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux)' online course, can't recomment enough.

Below you'll find instructions on how to run this app, feel free to use anything although I'd appreciate credits, mentions or links to my repository. Best of luck.

## Instructions:

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`
Installs all of the app dependencies, check out the package.json for more information.<br>

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
