          A React Hooks presentation that I made prior to introducing React Hooks into our development environment. The idea
          was to introduce the new React Hooks update to our tech team in the best way possible, so I made this presentation
          with an emphasis over practicality while at the same time being as comprehensive and up to date as possible.
        </div>
        <br />
        <div>
          It also features live, and interactive examples to showcase the potential of the amazing React Hooks.

    The first sketch (orange style color, 3rd photo), was more focused about the company instead of the app, but down the line we decided to take a different approach and use the flyers to promote the app instead.
    
    The first 2 photos show the final result.`

        Since I've had experience with Photoshop, I decided to tackle on this design after I was provided with the screenshots that featured different parts of the app.
        
        I began by creating the mock iPhone photos featuring parts of the app, then added a bit of colors and titles that pointed out the features, then voil√†!`

    Changed the canvas size, the mock phone was changed to a Nexus model, and used screenshots taken from an Android phone, the rest is history.`

    They're a spanish based company and their target audience is often spanish speakers, for this reason the flyer is in spanish as well, obviously.`
