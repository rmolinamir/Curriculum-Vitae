        My career started with a major in mechanical engineering, and have been programming professionally for over 3
        years in a variety of technologies and languages, including Python, JavaScript (andTypeScript), C++, and
        databases including relational SQL databases such as Django REST Framework, as well as No-SQL databases such as
        MongoDB.
      </P>
      <br />
      <P>
        I have been working with Python, JavaScript, and TypeScript almost exclusively since 2018, mainly in REST API
        development and data management and analysis using back-end databases such as SQL Server, Django REST Framework
        and MongoDB, as well as front-end applications built using frameworks such as React.js
      </P>
      <br />
      <P>
        I have invested a great deal of time and energy learning and increasing my knowledge to gain in-depth understanding
        of core programming concepts by writing many idiomatic programs, and I&apos;d like to share that to you. I&apos;ve
        certainly got a passion for programming for multiple reasons, and I&apos;d like to share that enthusiasm
        with you as well!
      </P>
